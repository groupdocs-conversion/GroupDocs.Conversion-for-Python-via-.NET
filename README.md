It preserves layout and formatting while offering customization options for each format. 

## Features

- **Flexible Conversion Options**: Convert entire documents, specific pages, page ranges, or files within document containers such as compressed files.
- **Format Detection**: Automatically detects the format of input files.

## Supported File Formats

GroupDocs.Conversion supports a wide range of file formats, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, OpenDocument, Image, Email, and many others. See the [full list of supported formats](http://docs.groupdocs.com/conversion/python-net/supported-file-formats/) for details.

## Get Started

1. **Set Up Environment**: Ensure that [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) runtime (or higher) are installed on your system.

2. **Get the Code**: Clone or download this repository.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:groupdocs-conversion/GroupDocs.Conversion-for-Python-via-.NET.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the `Examples` Folder**

   ```bash
   cd ./GroupDocs.Conversion-for-Python-via-.NET/Examples
   ```

4. **Install Package**: To install the package, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We typically keep the package up to date with the latest version. If you need to use a different package version, you can update the requirements.txt file accordingly.

   Alternatively, you can download the `whl` file for your operating system from the official [GroupDocs Releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/python-net/#direct-download) website. To install the package manually, copy the whl file to the `Examples` directory and run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   pip install ./groupdocs_conversion_net-*.whl
   ```

5. **Configure License (Optional)**: If you have a license file, you can set the license path in the `run_all_examples.py` file. By default, GroupDocs.Conversion for Python via .NET checks for the `GROUPDOCS_LIC_PATH` environment variable or looks for files with the `.lic` extension in the projectâ€™s root directory. You can also [get a temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license) to test all the features.

6. **Run the Examples**: To run all the examples, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python ./run_all_examples.py
   ```

   You can also run individual examples by navigating to the folder containing the example script and running it. Output files are placed in the same folder as the script file.
